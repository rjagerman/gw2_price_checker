GW2 price checker
=================

Guild Wars 2 price checker checks live prices of recipes and items using gw2 spidy's API.

It provides direct sell profit for opportunities to craft and sell immediately.
It also attempts to find ecto profit which are items that you can craft and then
salvage to sell the ectos for profit. These generally only show up if the market is
somewhat unstable (due to the introduction of some new stuff for example).
